##Mobility as starting point

More than a third of the visitors to the KwikFit site are viewing the site on their mobile device. So we focused on making the website fully responsive. After all, we want to give the site’s visitors the best possible experience. Our designers created surprising and detailed solutions for the new site. It provides the visitors with useful, intelligent, and simply beautiful interaction on all screen formats.

##Optimized orders
 
The new ordering system is streamlined and sends visitors straight to their objective. Because with the large and diverse offering that KwikFit has, some focus can be very helpful. The site is designed to be of the utmost assistance to its visitors and only presents logical choices. If you are making an appointment for an MOT test, you are given a different route to follow than someone looking for new tires. So site visitors are treated to super service and experience more convenience. And it shows in the conversion rates.
