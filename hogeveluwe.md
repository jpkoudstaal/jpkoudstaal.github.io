National Park de Hoge Veluwe partnered with Mangrove to create a beautiful immersive website that invites visitors to discover all the Park has to offer.

##Inspire to visit
The Park’s magnificent sceneries are put on display throughout the site creating an experience that inspires visitors to plan a visit. ‘Plan your trip’ provides all the practical information for a visit while ‘Discover the Park’ invites visitors to explore the nature, landscapes, art and architecture. Visitors can also learn more about the rich history of the Park by reading the historical tales.

##Design
We choose the golden ratio (a ratio found in nature and commonly used in art and architecture) to create beautiful photo collages that are pleasing to the human eye. We used a typeface that is as refined and historical as the Park is. Caslon, a typeface designed in the 18th century, has the right amount of elegance and is very legible as well. By thoughtfully combining italic type, ligatures and drop caps we created a design that invites the visitor to read and enjoy all the content the Park has to offer.

##Responsive by default
It goes without saying that the website has been built responsive. We used several responsive design techniques to make sure the initial page load is as small as possible without losing sight of the visual impact. This results in an online experience that is as good on mobile as it is on tablet or desktop.

We completely overhauled the booking-engine together with technical partner de Haan. We built a fully integrated webshop where visitors can buy tickets, books and make a reservation for an excursion – all within the same flow.

Hogeveluwe.nl is a website which not only provides practical information but above all inspires visitors by showcasing all of the beauty of the Park.
