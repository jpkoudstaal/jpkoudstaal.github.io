I am a designer working at [Mangrove](http://mangrove.com) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I enjoy good coffee, riding my bike to work, basketball and comic books.I spend my days creating beautiful and usable websites. In my spare time I like to spend time with my wife and my almost 4-year-old daughter Juliet. 

I like to travel, take photos whenever I can and am obsessed with New York City. I grew up on a steady diet of comic books and LEGOÂ®. I have been playing basketball since I was little and still do to this day.
