##Inspire to visit
The Park’s magnificent sceneries are put on display throughout the site creating an experience that inspires visitors to plan a visit. ‘Plan your trip’ provides all the practical information for a visit while ‘Discover the Park’ invites visitors to explore the nature, landscapes, art and architecture. Visitors can also learn more about the rich history of the Park by reading the historical tales.
 
##Design
We choose the golden ratio (a ratio found in nature and commonly used in art and architecture) to create beautiful photo collages that are pleasing to the human eye. We used a typeface that is as refined and historical as the Park is. Caslon, a typeface designed in the 18th century, has the right amount of elegance and is very legible as well. By thoughtfully combining italic type, ligatures and drop caps we created a design that invites the visitor to read and enjoy all the content the Park has to offer.

##Responsive by default
It goes without saying that the website has been built responsive. We used several responsive design techniques to make sure the initial page load is as small as possible without losing sight of the visual impact. This results in an online experience that is as good on mobile as it is on tablet or desktop.

> “Mangrove built a beautiful site for us. a visual story of art, nature and history focused on information and conversion.”

We built a fully integrated webshop where visitors can buy tickets, books and make a reservation for an excursion – all within the same flow. We also developed a special area where teachers can easily make a schooltrip reservation. In the development of the webshop we implemented the register software of De Haan.

Hogeveluwe.nl is a website which not only provides practical information but above all inspires visitors by showcasing all of the beauty of the Park.
